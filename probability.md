Sample Space
: set of all possible outcomes of an experiment
for example
    the sample space for rolling a die would be {1,2,3,4,5,6}

Event Space
: set of all events that can occur in the sample space

Event
: a set of outcomes that satisfy a condition
for example
    rolling a even number on a six sided die would be {2,4,6}

so then, 

then event space for flipping a coin would be {{}, {H}, {T}, {H,T}}

> note that {H,T} is an event, such that cooresponds to the event of all possible outcomes

$$\mathlarger{\epsilon}= \{ A : A \subseteq S \} $$

If $$|S|$$ is finite, then $$|\mathlarger{\epsilon}| = 2^{|S|}$$


## Practice
Experiment: Roll the 6-sided die 2 times

$S = \{(Roll_1, Roll_2) : Roll_1, Roll_2 \in \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}\}$

$|S| = 36$

$|\mathlarger{\epsilon}| = 2^{36}$
